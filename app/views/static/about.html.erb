<h2>About This Site</h2>

<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p>
  DreamTagger allows you to record and <strong>share your dreams</strong> with your friends and the rest
  of the world. By adding tags to your dreams (and other people's dreams!) you can help to create a
  <strong>network of dreams</strong> based on what they are about.
</p>
<p>
  Once we get a lot dreams on the site, you'll be able to see what people dream about on the
  <%= link_to "night before Christmas", dreams_by_day_path(:year=>'2008',:month=>'12',:day=>'25'),
    :title => 'Dreams from december 25' %>.
  You'll be able to find out how many people have dreams about
  <%= link_to "zombies", tag_dreams_path('zombies'), :title => 'Show dreams about zombies' %>
  or
  <%= link_to "falling", tag_dreams_path('zombies'), :title => 'Show dreams about falling' %>
  (does everybody have that one?).
</p>
<p>
  The key here is to get <strong>a lot of dreams</strong> from <strong>a lot of people</strong>. So,
  <%= link_to "create an account", new_account_path, :title => 'Show registration page.' %>
  for yourself, and then
  <%= link_to "invite your friends", 'new_invite_path', :title => 'Show invitation page.' %>
  to join in!
